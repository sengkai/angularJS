## About Me
I'm someone who likes to explore new stuff and would usually want to start off with some basic stuff to have a feel of how it works. AngularJS is not something new in the tech world but it's definitely something new for me even though I have heard about it for quite sometime. 

## Background
For this mini project, I'm attempting to do basic create and linking up friends and retriving of friend list etc. As I already have a friendmanagement mini project up and running. I would be using that as my backend thus AngularJS would concentrate on the frontend.

#### Prerequisite to start this project.
1. Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
