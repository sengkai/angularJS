## About Me
I'm someone who likes to explore new stuff and would usually want to start off with some basic stuff to have a feel of how it works. AngularJS is not something new in the tech world but it's definitely something new for me even though I have heard about it for quite sometime. 

## Background
For this mini project, I'm attempting to cover the following foundation of AngularJS
- Creating "Classes" (The same as how Java create entity)
- Syntax of AngularJS 
- Linking up between module, component, service class
- How each object communicate with each other
- Linking it up to a database to do CRUD

#### Prerequisite to start this project.
1. Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
